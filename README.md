# OS_Process-Scheduling-algorithms--

## Project Description

Here is an immplementation of Process Scheduling algorithm in operating systems. 
> Types of schedulers supported is:
- First Come First Serve Algorithm (FCFS).
- Shortest Jop First Algorithm (SJF Preemptive ) .
- Shortest Jop First Algorithm (SJF Non-Preemptive ).
- Priority ( Preemptive ) .
- Priority ( Non-Preemptive )
- Round Robin (RR). 

#####  Using: Python and GUI by pyqt5 .

## Hwo To Use The Progam .
When you run the project The Main Window will appear and you will choose what is the desired Algorithm to Run

 Then you should enter the nober of process  , prcess ID  , prcess Burst time and prcess Arrival time

 Then click simulat botton , the program wil show the average waiting time and the Gantt Chart for Running Process
